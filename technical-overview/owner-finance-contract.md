# Owner Finance Contract

### Overview

The **OwnerFinancing Contract** manages the financial agreement between a property seller and a buyer in a real estate transaction. The contract **serves as an end-to-end solution** for facilitating owner **financing of property** while incorporating multiple functionalities such as the creation of terms, approval, payment processing, and termination.

**Key Features of the OwnerFinancing Contract:**

1. **Stores Structured Financing Details**: Maintains a comprehensive data structure for each financing arrangement.
2. **Financing Terms and Conditions**: Provides mechanisms to set, approve, and change the terms of the financing.
3. **Payment Handling**: Manages incoming payments from buyers, deducts platform fees, and accrues the remaining amounts for the seller.
4. **Multi-Token Support**: Interfaces with **SellerNFT**, **BuyerNFT**, and **DeedNFT** contracts to mint and transfer Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that represent ownership and financing status.
5. **Withdrawal Management**: Allows for the withdrawal of funds for both buyers and sellers.
6. **Interest Rate Constraints**: Implements maximum allowable interest rates and adjustable rate increases.
7. **Event Logging**: Logs key events like financing creation, payments, and completion for auditing and tracking.
8. **Platform Fee Handling**: Takes platform fees from the down payments and monthly payments and sends them to the platform wallet.
9. **Ownership Transfers**: Facilitates the transfer of property ownership through **DeedNFTs** upon financing completion or default.

### **Contract Data Structure**

The OwnerFinancing Contract primarily manages its state through a struct named `FinancingDetails`, which includes the following elements:

* **Seller and Buyer Ethereum Addresses**: `address seller; address buyer;`
* **Property Price**: `uint256 price;`
* **Financing Term Length**: `uint256 termLength; // in months`
* **Interest Rate**: `uint256 interestRate; // in basis points`
* **Down Payment**: `uint256 downPayment;`
* **Approval Flags**: `bool isBuyerApproved; bool isTermsAccepted; bool isActive;`
* **Payments Status**: `uint256 totalPaymentsMade;`
* **Adjustable Rate Information**: `uint256 nextAdjustableRateIncrease; // in months`
* **Interest Type**: `InterestType interestType;`

```solidity
struct FinancingDetails {
    address seller;
    address buyer;
    uint256 price;
    // ... other fields
    InterestType interestType;
}
```

### **Core Contract Functions**

The OwnerFinancing Contract is a robust solution for automating the owner financing process in real estate transactions while incorporating the advantages of blockchain technology.

### Extended Functionality and Advanced Features

**Advanced Features:**

1. **Multi-Property Support**: Allows sellers to list multiple properties and link them to separate `FinancingDetails` structs.
2. **Interest Rate Cap**: Sets the upper limit on how much the interest rate can increase over time in case of an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM).
3. **Termination and Refund**: Provides options for both parties to terminate the contract early with specified consequences.
4. **Incentive Mechanisms**: Introduces incentives for timely payments, such as lowering the interest rate after a predefined number of on-time payments.
5. **Data Visibility**: Restricts the visibility of sensitive transaction details to authorized parties only.
6. **Automatic Default Handling**: Automatically triggers default scenarios based on predefined conditions, like missing payments for a certain period.

### **Advanced Contract Functions**
