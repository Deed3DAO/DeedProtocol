# Overview

The **Deed Protocol** is an innovative **Decentralized Application (DApp)** that harnesses blockchain technology to digitize the entire spectrum of property transactions. It serves as a pioneering **protocol**, enabling property owners to register their properties and mint unique **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)** that represent ownership. This groundbreaking solution caters to a variety of properties, including **Land, Real Estate, Vehicles, and Commercial Equipment**.

### How it Works

At the heart of the Deed Protocol is the **Property Registration Contract**, the minting machine of **Deed NFTs**. Each Deed NFT stands unique, tethered to a specific real-world property.

* **Property Types**: The properties come classified into distinct types such as Land, Vehicles, Real Estate, etc.
* **NFT Information**: Each NFT carries a token URI that points to a JSON file containing exhaustive information about the property.

**Users** interact with the protocol through a series of steps:

1. **Property Registration**: Users initiate their journey by registering their property, providing necessary documents, and proving their ownership.
2. **Off-Chain Verification**: The Deed Protocol team verifies these documents off-chain, ensuring the integrity of the process.
3. **Minting the DeedNFT**: Upon verification, users receive a verification code, which they can utilize to mint the DeedNFT that signifies their property.

The protocol extends its functionality by incorporating a **Leasing Mechanism** that allows property owners to lease their properties.

* **Lease Agreement**: The terms of the lease, such as rent, deposit, lease period, and more, are dictated by a smart contract.
* **Lease Payments**: Leases can be remunerated using ERC20 tokens such as xDAI.

Owners also have the option to **Sell their Properties** via the platform.

* **Purchase Methods**: Potential buyers can secure properties through bidding, direct sales, or Dutch auctions.
* **Purchase Process**: A purchase entails not only on-chain transactions but also off-chain actions such as signing of traditional agreements like purchase agreements.

### Technical Overview

Deed Protocol stands built with **Solidity** for smart contracts on the **Ethereum blockchain** and is compatible with the **Gnosis (xDAI) Chain**. It complies with the **ERC-721 standard** for NFTs, adding functionalities tailored for property management, leasing, and sales.

* **IPFS Storage**: The protocol exploits IPFS for storing property metadata, assuring data immutability and permanence.
* **Wallet Compatibility**: Users can manage their Deed NFTs using their preferred Ethereum wallet, highlighting user convenience.
* **Transfer Fees**: The protocol leverages EIP-2981 standard for royalty fees, ensuring a percentage of every on-chain sale circles back to the platform to cover off-chain costs.

### Legal Framework

Operating within an intertwined legal framework of traditional property law and blockchain technology, the Deed Protocol offers an innovative solution that combines the best of both worlds.

* **Property Wrappers**: These are adaptable legal structures, including LLCs and Nominee Trusts, designed to seamlessly integrate real-world assets with blockchain technology. They ensure legal compliance, provide asset protection, and facilitate digital transactions.
* **Traditional Agreements**: Deed Protocol utilizes traditional agreements such as lease agreements and purchase agreements to ensure legal compliance and clarity of terms.
* **Verification & KYC**: The protocol stresses user verification and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes. All parties involved in a purchase or lease agreement must undergo KYC procedures to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

With this, the **Deed Protocol** presents a revolutionary blend of blockchain technology and traditional property law, providing a streamlined, secure, and decentralized platform for property registration, management, leasing, and sales.

### Fees & Service Charges

Utilizing the Deed Protocol comes with certain fees and service charges that are essential for maintaining and developing the system. We've aimed to keep the structure as transparent and user-friendly as possible. Below is a summary of these costs:

* **Gas Fees**: As with any Ethereum-based DApp, executing transactions on the Deed Protocol requires payment of network gas fees. These fees are not collected by the Deed Protocol but are used to incentivize miners who validate and add transactions to the Ethereum blockchain.
* **Minting Fees**: When you mint a DeedNFT, there is a nominal fee associated with it. This fee supports the costs of the smart contract execution.
* **Transaction Fees (Royalties)**: Deed Protocol utilizes a royalty system for on-chain transactions of DeedNFTs. Each time a DeedNFT changes ownership through a sale, a 5% fee is applied and paid to the platform. These fee support the ongoing development of the Deed Protocol and cover both the associated with on-chain computation and off-chain administrative costs
* **Lease Agreement Fees**: When initiating a lease agreement, a certain fee applies. This fee contributes to maintaining and servicing the agreement on the protocol.
* **Dispute Resolution Fees**: In the case of disputes arising from leasing agreements or DeedNFT transactions, a fee will be required to engage the dispute resolution system and services of the protocol.

Please note that fees are subject to change and can vary based on the nature of the transaction and the current conditions of the Ethereum network. Always ensure to check the specific fee details at the time of conducting any transaction. Your understanding and support help us maintain and continuously improve the Deed Protocol.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the **Deed Protocol** is an innovative application leveraging the decentralization and transparency offered by blockchain technology to disrupt the real estate and property industry. By digitizing the entire spectrum of property transactions, it ensures convenience, security, and seamless management for property owners, leasers, and buyers.

Moreover, the protocol is not a static creation. It thrives and evolves through the invaluable input and expertise from the global developer community and passionate property enthusiasts.
