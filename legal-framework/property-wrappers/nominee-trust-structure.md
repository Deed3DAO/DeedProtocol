# Nominee Trust Structure

### Overview

This is an **advanced asset protection** strategy gaining traction within the realm of real estate management. This approach is **parallel to the use of Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)** in that it also provides a legal structure to individual properties.&#x20;

**However**, Nominee Trusts offer **an enhanced layer of anonymity** alongside other additional benefits when integrated within a Blockchain-Based Property Management tool such as the **Deed Protocol**, revolutionizing how **RWAs (Real-World Assets)** are managed, transferred, and secured.

### Purpose and Benefits

The implementation of Nominee Trusts as Property Wrappers carries several significant advantages:

1. **Legal Protection**: Similar to LLCs, the Nominee Trust serves as a legal vehicle that isolates liabilities. It minimizes risks to other assets owned by the property holder and offers a degree of asset protection against legal challenges.
2. **Anonymity**: One unique benefit of using a Nominee Trust is the layer of privacy it offers. Ownership details can be obscured, making it less straightforward for third parties to identify the real property owners.
3. **Efficiency**: With ownership details being managed through a trust, property transactions can become less cumbersome. On the Deed Protocol platform, this can further expedite the process of property transfers.
4. **Flexibility**: The structure of Nominee Trusts allows for sophisticated arrangements of ownership and operation, thus providing the flexibility that can be particularly useful in complex real estate portfolios.

### Process of Creating Legal Wrappers with Nominee Trusts

In this Nominee Trust structure, **The Deed & Title Company, LLC.** acts as the Trustee and Administrator. They are responsible for managing the trust's operations and ensuring compliance with legal requirements. Their role adds an **additional layer of professionalism and expertise** to the trust formation and management process.

### **Step 1: Gather Property Information**

In this preliminary stage, you will need to assemble all the essential details related to the property you wish to wrap in a Nominee Trust. This encompasses:

* **Legal Description of Property**: A formal account or summary that identifies the property based on officially recognized maps and surveys.
* **Current Owner Details**: Information about the person(s) or entity currently holding the property, including their legal name and contact information.
* **Assessed Value**: The value of the property as determined by official appraisal or market analysis.
* **Required Disclosures**: Any legally mandated information that must be disclosed about the property, such as existing liens, history of damages, or other material facts.

Having a detailed and comprehensive data set is crucial for the formation of the trust and for the creation of the subsequent DeedNFT.

### **Step 2: Formation of the Trust**

Instead of an LLC, a Nominee Trust is formed, generally involving the following steps:

* **Trust Name Selection**: Choose an anonymous or nondescript name for the trust.
* **Trust Agreement Drafting**: Create the trust agreement outlining the terms, responsibilities of the trustee, and details on beneficiaries.
* **Notarization and Recording**: Depending on jurisdiction, notarize and record the trust agreement.
* **Obtaining a Tax Identification Number (TIN)**: Required for tax purposes, similar to an EIN in LLC formation.

### Step 3: Deed Transfer

* **Drafting a New Deed**: Prepare a deed transfer document, moving ownership from the individual or previous entity to the newly-formed Nominee Trust.
* **Securing Signatures**: Obtain all required signatures for the new deed.
* **Recording the Deed**: File the new deed with the appropriate local government agency.

Once these steps are completed, the property is legally owned by the trust. The corresponding **DeedNFT** can now be minted and issued within the Deed Protocol platform.

### Conclusion

Whether you're a private homeowner or an institutional investor, understanding the nuances of using a Nominee Trust as a Property Wrapper will be an invaluable asset. It enables you to fully utilize the Deed Protocol platform and navigate complex asset structures efficiently.
