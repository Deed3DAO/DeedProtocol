# Limited Liability Company

### Overview

Utilizing **Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) as Property Wrappers** takes well-established asset protection strategies from traditional real estate and brings them into the digital age by assigning each distinct property to its own LLC.&#x20;

This provides property owners with an unique combination of **legal protection**, **efficiency**, and **flexibility** and when seamlessly integrated into the **Blockchain-Based Property Management** tool such as the **Deed Protocol**, it revolutionizes how RWAs (Real-World Assets) can be managed, transferred, and secured.

### Purpose and Benefits

The practice of housing individual properties within **legal entities**, typically **Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)**, has several significant advantages:

1. **Legal Protection**: Each LLC acts as a legal shield, creating a barrier that limits potential liabilities related to the property, thereby protecting the owner's other assets. For instance, if a lawsuit were brought against the property, only the assets held in the LLC would be at risk, not the owner's personal assets or those belonging to their other LLCs.
2. **Efficiency**: By housing the property in an LLC, property transfers become an operation of changing the LLC's ownership. This operation can be executed quickly and efficiently on the Deed Protocol platform, reducing the administrative burden usually associated with property transfers.
3. **Flexibility**: LLC structures provide for flexible ownership and operational arrangements. They facilitate fractional ownership, enabling multiple owners to hold a stake in the same property. Additionally, they support adaptable leasing arrangements, providing a clear and straightforward process for managing leases and rent collections.

### Process of Creating Legal Wrappers with LLCs

The establishment of a legal wrapper encompasses several critical steps:

### Step 1: Gather Property Information

The first step to creating a legal wrapper involves gathering comprehensive **information about the property**. This includes:

* Legal description of the property
* Details about the current owner(s)
* Assessed value of the property
* Any necessary disclosures

Having a comprehensive set of property data forms the basis for creating the legal entity and its corresponding DeedNFT.

### Step 2: Entity Formation

A unique **LLC is formed for each property**. This step generally encompasses:

* Selecting a unique name for the LLC
* Registering the LLC with the appropriate state agency
* Paying the required filing fees
* Obtaining an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS

Upon the completion of this process, the LLC stands as a separate legal entity.

### Step 3: Deed Transfer

The final stage involves transferring the property's deed from the current owner to the newly formed LLC. This effectively turns the LLC into the property's legal owner. The transfer process comprises:

* Drafting a new deed
* Securing the necessary signatures
* Recording the deed with the appropriate local government office

At the end of this process, the property is now "housed" within its own LLC, and the corresponding DeedNFT can be minted and issued.

The process outlined above concludes the creation of a legal wrapper for your property so whether you're an individual property owner or an experienced real estate investment firm, understanding this unique process is fundamental to leveraging the full potential of our platform.&#x20;
