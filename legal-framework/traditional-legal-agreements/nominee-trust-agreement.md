# Nominee Trust Agreement

This Nominee Trust Agreement (the "Agreement") is initiated by the Grantor through the creation of a DeedNFT. All defining characteristics of this trust (the "Trust") are embedded within the DeedNFT to which this Agreement is associated.

***

**Recitals**

**Whereas**, blockchain technology offers an advanced, fortified, and interoperable system, signaling a paradigm shift in representing ownership of digital and tangible assets. It achieves this via an immutable electronic ledger which chronicles every transaction with precision and security.

**Whereas**, the Grantor seeks to synergize the tangible property ownership with the digital world, thus aiming to utilize a DeedNFT as a digital emblem of real property ownership, reaping the benefits and efficiencies of digital operations and services.

**Whereas**, on the issuance of the DeedNFT, the Grantor intends to embed this Agreement within the DeedNFT, envisaging this Agreement as the cornerstone governing document that defines the entity holding tangible property. This step ensures that a consistent and interoperable protocol is maintained, housing all critical attributes of this Agreement within the DeedNFT.

**Now, therefore**, in acknowledgment of the agreements herein and contingent upon their adherence, the parties mutually concur as follows:

***

**1. Trust Objective**

The Trust's foundational objective is to manifest a binding legal nexus wherein possession of the DeedNFT on the Ethereum blockchain corroborates and reflects ownership of the corresponding tangible property. This intricate alignment ensures the swift, cost-effective, and foolproof management, transfer, and utilization of real property rights within the digital realm.

**3. Formalizing the Trust**

Establishing this Agreement necessitates a multi-step procedure:

1. The Grantor, either autonomously or via delegation, initializes the Trust by crafting a DeedNFT within the Deed Protocol.
2. Subsequently, the Grantor integrates the tangible Property into the Trust's fold through an authenticated deed. This action is corroborated by registering the transaction with the pertinent regulatory authority.
3. Post successful validation, this Agreement, accompanied by supplementary documentation such as the conveyance deed, is intrinsically linked to the DeedNFT's Metadata.

***

**4. Transactions and Engagements with Deed Protocol**

All digital engagements, be it confirmations, transfers, or modifications, effected using private cryptographic keys on the Ethereum network in relation to the DeedNFT or the Trust, are deemed irrevocable, conclusive, and binding, endowed with the weightage and reverence of traditionally ratified paper agreements.

***

**5. Grantor's Obligations and Representations**

Upon the successful establishment of the Trust and the Property's integration therein, the Grantor relinquishes any residual rights, entitlements, or claims over the Property and the DeedNFT. Henceforth, the Beneficiary emerges as the sole entity vested with comprehensive rights, responsibilities, and entitlements pertaining to the Property, the DeedNFT, and the Trust.

***

**6. Beneficiary's Entitlements**

The Beneficiary, or an authorized representative thereof, is empowered to engage with and execute a diverse array of functions within the Deed Protocol. This encompasses decisions and actions concerning the DeedNFT, the tangible Property, and the Trust. The Beneficiary stands as the ultimate authority, dictating the trajectory of the Trust and ensuring its operations are in harmony with the tenets of this Agreement.

***

**7. Transfer of DeedNFT**

The Beneficiary possesses the privilege to transfer or reassign the DeedNFT to a different Ethereum Account. Upon the successful authentication and validation of this transfer, the new Account holder is ceremoniously recognized as the succeeding Beneficiary of the Trust.

***

**8. Trustee's Duties, Remunerations, and Protections**

The Trustee is entrusted with a myriad of responsibilities, encompassing the safeguarding of the Trust's integrity, representing the Trust, and making informed decisions in the best interests of the Beneficiary. The Trustee is shielded from any liabilities stemming from the Property's fluctuating value or any external factors impacting the Trust, barring any actions or decisions that betray this Agreement's spirit.

***

**9. No Singular Ownership; Trust Yields**

***

**10. Trust Dissolution**

The dissolution of the Trust is orchestrated through a meticulous procedure that safeguards all stakeholders' interests. This involves validating and verifying the Beneficiary's instructions, completing all requisite legal formalities, and ensuring the successful transition of the Property's title and ownership.
