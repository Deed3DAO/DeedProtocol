# Dispute Resolution

### Overview

Handling **Dispute Resolution** is a critical part of the **Legal Framework** section of the **Deed Protocol** documentation. In every transactional ecosystem, disputes may arise. They are particularly common in property-related transactions due to their high-value nature and the inherent complexities. This guide aims to elucidate the process of dispute resolution within the Deed Protocol ecosystem.

### Step 1: Understanding the Nature of Disputes

**Disputes in the Deed Protocol Ecosystem**

In the Deed Protocol ecosystem, you might encounter a variety of potential disputes. These could include:

* **Disagreements over lease terms**: The leasee and leasor may have different interpretations of the lease agreement.
* **Discrepancies in property details**: The details of the property as registered in the DeedNFT may not match the physical condition or attributes of the property.
* **Dissatisfaction with property conditions**: The leasee may find the property conditions unsatisfactory, leading to disputes.
* **Non-payment of dues**: The leasee may default on lease payments, leading to disputes.

### Step 2: Initiating the Dispute Resolution Process

**Reporting a Dispute**

If you find yourself entangled in a dispute, the Deed Protocol platform provides a user-friendly interface to **log your dispute**. This initiates the dispute resolution process. When lodging your dispute, you'll need to provide:

* **Comprehensive details**: You must describe the nature of your dispute, the parties involved, and any other relevant information.
* **Supporting documents**: Any documents that can support your claim or help clarify the situation should be provided.

### Step 3: Dispute Evaluation

**Mediators Assessing the Dispute**

Upon the lodging of a dispute, it will be assessed by our team of **mediators**. Mediators are impartial individuals or entities tasked with the responsibility of examining and managing disputes. They:

* **Examine the dispute**: Mediators conduct a thorough examination of the dispute based on the supporting documents and dispute details.
* **Consider agreement terms**: The terms and conditions stipulated in the Deed Protocol agreement are critical to the assessment process.

### Step 4: Mediation

**Engaging in Mediation**

After the assessment, mediators will engage both parties in a **mediation process**. This process includes:

* **Creating dialogue**: Mediators facilitate conversations between the disputing parties.
* **Fostering agreement**: The goal is to find a resolution acceptable to all parties involved.

### Step 5: Resolution

**Arriving at a Resolution**

In case mediation leads to a mutually agreed resolution, mediators will facilitate the decision's implementation. However, if mediation does not yield an agreement, the mediators will be tasked to make a final and binding decision based on:

* **Available evidence**: All supporting documents and details of the dispute are considered.
* **Deed Protocol principles**: The decision will adhere to the rules and spirit of the Deed Protocol platform.

### Step 6: Execution

**Implementing the Resolution**

The final step in the dispute resolution process involves the execution of the agreed or determined resolution. The execution could involve:

* **Amendments to the lease agreement**: Necessary changes may be made to the lease agreement in accordance with the resolution.
* **Payment of damages**: If the resolution involves compensatory damages, the party responsible will be required to make the payment.

Deed Protocol aims to minimize disputes through clear communication and precise agreement terms. However, if disputes do arise, rest assured that the protocol possesses a robust and fair dispute resolution process.
