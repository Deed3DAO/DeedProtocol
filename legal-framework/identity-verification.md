# Identity Verification

In an effort to ensure Deed Protocol remains a legitimate business operation and a platform for legal, transparent transactions, compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Business (KYB) procedures is crucial.

### Individual Users:

**Purpose of Identity Verification for Individuals**

Identity verification serves to confirm the identity of an individual. This process is important to:

1. **Prevent Identity Theft**: This step confirms the individual's identity, preventing account creation under stolen or false identities.
2. **Prevent Fraud**: Verification ensures all transactions are traceable to a specific, verified individual, thus safeguarding against fraudulent activities.
3. **Compliance with Laws and Regulations**: Compliance with KYC requirements helps us adhere to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws and fulfill other legal obligations.

**Requirements for Individuals**

KYC procedures for individuals include:

1. **Personal Information**: Full name, date of birth, nationality, and residential address.
2. **Government-Issued Identification**: Submission of a government-issued document such as a passport, national ID, or driving license.
3. **Additional Verification**: In some cases, further verification such as a live selfie or video call may be necessary to match the person creating the account with the provided identification.

### Organizations (Traditional or Hybrid):

**Purpose of Identity Verification for Organizations**

Identity verification for organizations confirms the legitimacy of a business or DAO. It ensures:

1. **Business Legitimacy**: Verification verifies the legal existence of the business and prevents business identity theft.
2. **AML Compliance**: It ensures the businesses are not involved in illegal activities and are in compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements.
3. **Risk Assessment**: Verification aids in assessing the risk level of potential business relationships and informs decision-making.

**Requirements for Organizations**

KYB procedures typically involve:

1. **Business Details**: Business name, address, registration number.
2. **Proof of Business Registration**: Business license, certificate of incorporation, articles of association need to be submitted.
3. **DAO Specifics**: For DAOs, the blockchain address of the DAO and the list of members with their roles.
