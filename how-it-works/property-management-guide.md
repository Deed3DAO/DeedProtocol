# Property Management Guide

### **Getting Started with Property Management**

Once you are logged in, you will be directed to your personalized **Dashboard**. This is your command center for managing your properties. To view all properties you own, go to the **'My Properties'** section. The properties listed here include those you've registered yourself and those you've acquired from others.

#### **Understanding Property Details**

By clicking on a property, you get a comprehensive view of its details:

* **Property Type**: Understand if it's land, a vehicle, commercial equipment, or real estate.
* **Current Status**: Determine if it's available for lease, for sale, or already under lease.
* **On-chain Data & Documentation**: Access all the blockchain data and documents associated with the property.

### **Property Actions**

In the property details view, you have multiple options for managing your property:

* **List Your Property**: Decide to lease or sell.
* **Lease Applications**: Accept or reject applications for leases.
* **Lease Management**: Handle ongoing leases effectively.
* **Sale Bids**: Accept or reject purchase bids.

All these actions are performed within the platform, providing a seamless user experience.

### **Managing Property Bids**

When you have your property up for bids, the property details view shows you:

* **Highest Bid**: View the current top offer for your property.
* **Bid History**: Check the past bids.
* **Bidder Details**: Know who is interested in your property.
* **Bid Acceptance/Rejection**: Decide on the offers you've received.

Once you accept a bid, the platform assists you in transferring the DeedNFT to the new owner and receiving your proceeds.

### **Lease Management**

Within the property details view, you can easily manage all ongoing leases:

* **Lease Terms**: Understand the conditions for each lease.
* **Lessee Details**: Know who is leasing your property.
* **Payment Status**: Keep track of rent payments.

The platform also enables the handling of lease renewals, applications, and terminations.

### **Selling Properties**

From the property details view, you can list your property for sale:

* **Listing Options**: Choose from traditional bidding, Dutch auction, or direct sale.
* **Bid/Offer Management**: Keep track of all bids or offers.
* **Sale Process**: Manage the entire sale process from here.

**List Options Breakdown**

* **Direct Sale**: If you prefer a straightforward sale, you can set a price for your asset and sell it directly to any interested buyer who agrees to your price.
* **Traditional Bidding**: You can list your asset for a traditional bid process. Interested buyers will place their bids over a specified period, and you can choose the highest bid at the end.
* **Dutch Auction**: In a Dutch Auction, the price of the asset starts high and decreases over time until someone agrees to buy it. This method can accelerate the sales process and can be a good choice if you want to sell your asset quickly.

### **Off-chain and On-chain Actions**

Our platform unifies all off-chain and on-chain actions under one user-friendly interface:

* **Off-chain**: Traditional agreements and documentation.
* **On-chain**: Creation and transfer of DeedNFTs, lease agreements, and payment processing.

### **Organization Management**

If you're part of an organization that owns properties on the platform, these can also be managed from your dashboard. Navigate to the **'My Organizations'** section to view and manage all the properties owned by your organizations and you can manage your organization's properties by:

* **Navigate to 'My Organizations'**: Here you will see a list of all organizations you are a part of.
* **Managing Organization Properties**: Clicking on an organization will take you to a detailed view, where you can see and manage all the properties owned by the organization.
*   **Actions**: Perform the same actions as with your personal properties.



Remember, property management is a crucial aspect of being a property owner on the platform. Make sure to regularly check your dashboard and stay updated on your property status, bids, leases, and sales. Our support team is always here to assist you with any questions or help you might need.
