# Property Leasing Guide

This guide will take you through the process of leasing a property, managing the lease, and making lease payments on our platform.

### **Step 1: Browse Available Properties**

To begin the leasing process, you'll first need to find a property that suits your needs.

1. **Access the Platform**: Start by accessing our platform via your web browser. Enter the URL into your browser to land on our homepage.
2. **Log In to Your Account**: In the top right corner of the homepage, click on 'Login.' Enter your email and password, then click 'Submit' to log in. If you don't have an account yet, click 'Sign Up' and follow the prompts to create one.
3. **Navigate to 'Properties'**: Once you're logged in, you'll be taken to your user dashboard. Look for a navigation menu on the left side of the page. Click on 'Properties' to view all available properties.
4. **Browse and Filter**: On the properties page, you'll see a list of all available properties. You can browse through this list or use the filters at the top to narrow down your options. You can filter properties by type (real estate, land, vehicle, commercial equipment), location, lease terms, and price.

### **Step 2: Apply for a Lease**

After you've selected a property that you'd like to lease, you will need to submit a lease application.

1. **Select a Property**: Click on the property you're interested in. This will bring up a page with detailed information about the property and the lease terms.
2. **Review Lease Terms**: Carefully review the lease terms presented. These terms include details about the lease duration, monthly payments, due dates, and more. Ensure you understand and agree to these terms before proceeding.
3. **Submit Lease Application**: If you agree with the lease terms, click the 'Apply for Lease' button. Fill in the application form with your information and click 'Submit.'

### **Step 3: Await Approval**

Once you've submitted the lease application, you will have to wait for the property owner or manager to review it.

1. **Check Application Status**: You can check the status of your application from your dashboard. Navigate to 'My Applications' to view the list of applications you've submitted and their statuses.
2. **Submit Deposit Upon Approval**: If your application is approved, you will receive a notification. You will then need to submit the deposit as mentioned in the lease terms to start the lease.

### **Step 4: Manage Your Lease**

Once your lease request is approved, you can manage your lease from your dashboard.

1. **Navigate to 'My Leases'**: From your dashboard, click on 'My Leases.' Here, you'll see all your current leases.
2. **View Lease Details**: Click on a lease to view its details. Here, you'll see information such as payment dates, the property owner's contact information, and the lease agreement document.
3. **Keep Track of Due Dates**: Keep an eye on your lease's payment due dates. Setting a reminder can help ensure you make your payments on time.

### **Step 5: Make Lease Payments**

Lease payments on our platform are secure and straightforward.

1. **Navigate to Payments**: From the lease details page, click on 'Payments.' Here, you'll see all upcoming and past payments.
2. **Select Due Payment**: When a payment is due, it will be highlighted. Click on the 'Pay Now' button next to the due payment.
3. **Confirm Payment**: A confirmation popup will appear. Review the payment details, then click 'Confirm' to proceed.
4.  **Wait for Confirmation**: The platform will process your payment and initiate a transaction on the blockchain. Once the transaction is confirmed, the payment will be marked as 'Paid' on the 'Payments' page.



Remember, late payments may incur penalties as per the lease agreement. Therefore, it's essential to make your payments on time. If you encounter any issues or have questions, contact our support team using the 'Help' or 'Support' button.

### **Step 6: Lease Termination**

A lease can be terminated under certain circumstances as defined in the lease agreement, or if it is not renewed at the end of the term.

1. **By the Leasee**: As the leasee, you may have the option to terminate the lease under certain circumstances outlined in your lease agreement. If such a situation arises, please refer to your agreement for guidance.
2. **By the Lessor**: The lessor may terminate the lease if you fail to make lease payments for three consecutive months, or if the lease is not renewed at the end of its term. In such cases, the lessor will follow the procedures outlined in the lease agreement.
3. **Security Deposit Refund**: After the termination of the lease, your security deposit will be returned, typically within 15-30 days. This is subject to a review of the property by a third-party administrator or property manager to verify that no excessive damage that violates the lease terms has occurred.
4. **Check Lease Status**: You can check the status of your lease at any time under 'My Leases' on your dashboard.

Remember, it's crucial to keep your account information secure, as your lease contracts are linked to your account. Losing access to your account may result in complications with your leases. If you have any questions or need help, our support team is always here to assist you.
